Trying out different things using the Mongo DataBase.

Basic show,delete,insert and search functions, will be expanding.

ToDo:

- Add more tables and perform basic functions.
- Add multiple databases and perform basic functions again.
- Shuffeling data from one db to another.
- Introduce WPF pages to get/send data from/to the user.
- Remove console input and use console in combination with txt.file for logging purposes.
- Remove useless comments, XML as i go along (testing purposes only).
- Learn finer details of using Git (don't have a fucking clue as to what pull, branch means).
- Grow beard further and pull hair when failures.maxValue.
